# Weather_Prediction_of_Dhaka_Delhi
## CSE303 Prediction Project

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that analyze and predict temperature trends for the cities of Delhi and Dhaka. The project explores data visualization, preprocessing, and the application of machine learning models for prediction.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. **Project_CSE303_Delhi_Prediction.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Focuses on analyzing and predicting temperature trends in Delhi.
   - **Key Sections**:
     - Importing necessary libraries.
     - Loading the dataset.
     - Visualization and data preprocessing.
     - Year-wise and month-wise temperature analysis.

### 2. **Project_CSE303_Dhaka_Prediction.ipynb**
   - **Description**: Similar to the Delhi notebook but tailored for Dhaka.
   - **Key Sections**:
